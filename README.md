# Course CPS-593 Web Server Programming

## About this Repository

This repository holds all of my assignments and final project for CPS-593 Web Server Programming.  
The final project for this course will be a full-stack application to track a user's exercises and fitness.

## Assignments

### Unit 2 Git

As assigned, I create the two required repositories.  
One to hold all of my in-class work, and this one to hold my assignments and final project.  
As part of this assignment I have added the `no-framework` directory to this project. I have also created a subfolder `Unit 2` that contains my five-file website generated by artificial intelligence. The site has pages for Home, About, Login, Register, and Profile. I wanted to keep it generic as it was not discussed if this was to be the start of the final project or just an exercise.

### Unit 3 Deploying

For this unit, I created the base of a Fitness App website with multiple pages including Home, About, Workouts, Community, Login, Register, and Profile. I also recreated an existing webpage as part of the assignment.

**Hosting:** The site is deployed on both **GitHub Pages** and **Render**, providing two hosting options with automatic deployments from the repository.

**Live Sites:**
- **Render:** [https://final-project-cps-593-web-server.onrender.com/no-framework/index.html](https://final-project-cps-593-web-server.onrender.com/no-framework/index.html)
- **GitHub Pages:** [https://j-elie.github.io/Final-Project-CPS-593-Web-Server-Programming/no-framework/index.html](https://j-elie.github.io/Final-Project-CPS-593-Web-Server-Programming/no-framework/index.html)

### Unit 4 Bulma

For this unit, I explored the Bulma CSS framework to create responsive and styled web pages without writing custom CSS. Using elements from the official Bulma documentation, I recreated another page designed by Professor Plotkin.

The page includes a navigation bar with dropdown menus, buttons with Font Awesome icons, and various Bulma components. This assignment demonstrated how CSS frameworks like Bulma can speed up development by providing pre-built, responsive design patterns that work across different screen sizes.
