# Course CPS-593 Web Server Programming

## About this Repository

This repository holds all of my assignments and final project for CPS-593 Web Server Programming.  
The final project for this course will be a full-stack application to track a user's exercises and fitness.

## Assignments

### Unit 2 Git

As assigned, I create the two required repositories.  
One to hold all of my in-class work, and this one to hold my assignments and final project.  
As part of this assignment I have added the `no-framework` directory to this project. I have also created a subfolder `Unit 2` that contains my five-file website generated by artificial intelligence. The site has pages for Home, About, Login, Register, and Profile. I wanted to keep it generic as it was not discussed if this was to be the start of the final project or just an exercise.

### Unit 3 Deploying

For this unit, I created the base of a Fitness App website with multiple pages including Home, About, Workouts, Community, Login, Register, and Profile. I also recreated an existing webpage as part of the assignment.

**Hosting:** The site is deployed on both **GitHub Pages** and **Render**, providing two hosting options with automatic deployments from the repository.
